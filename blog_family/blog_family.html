                    A family is the one of the most important blessing bestowed upon mankind, if it wasn’t we would be more like an animals, animals who herd around each other but not with their family. For many of us friends and late night gatherings are far more important than our families, we are a generation who prefer hanging out with strangers but not with our brothers, we are a generation that prefers hanging out with our friends but not with our parents. In the name of urbanization we have forgotten our customs and traditions, the most important aspects of which was a family life.   
                <br>
                Not so long ago, but if we look at the generation of our fathers, we’ll realize the importance of family life, back then in the era of my father parents use to have many children, like more than four and five, and according to my relatives they all use to gather at one place for two-days every weekend, they use to hang out together, cook together, live together and many at times also die together.    
                <br>
                Life back then was quite easy every individual was perfect in terms of time management, it’s not that people back then didn’t had friends, they did, but were more of a family friends, and if not then they were not given so much of preference as of today, uncles aunts everyone was familiar with each other and not just familiarization people knew their relatives from long distance personally, and yet we are who don’t even know the names of our second cousins, back then every individual was not just aware of their second and third cousins but they were like friends, and here we are who are just familiar with some of our first cousins. Actually we don’t give it a thought, if we would’ve then we must have thought about what’s more important in life, friends will come and go, and they’ll come again, but we only have one family, if lost, then we can’t get it back.    
                <br>
                <q>It’s been said that back then people’s houses were small but they were big at heart, and now we have big houses but we are small at heart</q>
