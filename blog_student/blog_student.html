                    Competency is the only principle we've been learning over the years, since our early childhood competition is the only thing we've given importance to, every student wants to get ahead or want to ace his or her studies but due to many reasons they aren't able to. What we've been taught for years is to beat our fellow competitors instead of learning. So why don't we focus on learning? Why we focus on competition rather than knowledge? And what could be the possible outcome of this legacy?
                    
                    <br>The thing that we misses out is that every student has a different mental state, some of them learns very fast, some of them don't, many of them are very good at math, and many aren't. But we tend to overlook this fact and pressurize student to outperform his or her abilities. However years later, many of us realize the importance of learning over grades and knowledge over competency, probably that is the reason why many students are just enrolled in their bachelors to get a degree, besides they want to run their own business and as per many students they don't need to study in order to do a business. Besides our society believes that our age defines our maturity and our experience defines our wisdom, which is true but in relative terms it’s not.
                    
                    
                    <br><q>If you're against the flow that doesn't mean you're wrong</q>
                    
                    <br>Nowadays students are more towards learning than grades, quoting one of my teacher's saying "Grades doesn't define your ability to perform" and according to Jack Maa "Bad grades are good for your success as it enhances your learning" Students at universities are running after their GPA, overlooking the fact that a good GPA will only give them a push besides it never assures you of your success. There are students who have scored good Gpa and are performing worse and there are students who have scored average or bad Gpa but are performing impressively well.
                    
                    <br>So should we focus on grades or learning, or should we focus on knowledge rather than exams. Many of us believe that exams are just a tool to test our knowledge but according to Thomas Edison "A single piece of paper can't decide my future"
                    <br><q>Perhaps we are focusing on wrong domain, or perhaps we are reverse performing our operations</q>
